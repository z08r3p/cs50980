2.   Write down your solution/answer to each question in the   space provided   in THIS assignment paper.
3.   Necessary calculations and/or formulas MUST be included in your   solutions/answers.
4.   Key   concepts/methods/formulas   and t-table   can   be   found   from   the   textbook   or   lecture   notes,   or   from   the   review   document available from the course   iSpace.

Round your calculation results to THREE (3) decimals to achieve   higher   accuracy,   unless   clearly unnecessary.Miss Ariel, a   smart   girl   of   the beautiful Ultimate   Imagination   College   (UIC) which   currently   has   9,260   students,   is   attending an Artistic Emotion (AE) class. Because of   her learning experience, she is interested in examining whether   or not harder study will lead to better learning outcome and, if   yes, by how much, which can be   simplified to examine   the relationship between   GPA   (y)   and   average   daily   study-hour   (x).   For   that purpose,   yesterday   she   went to   UIC’s   University Road, to do a   survey.   She randomly   surveyed 10 UIC   students   with   each   student’s   GPA   (y)   and   average   daily   study-hour   (x) recorded   as   follows, where, taking   student #5 for   example, x5 = 12 andy5 = 3.3 imply that   she (or   he) studied 12 hours   everyday   in   average   and   her   (or   his)   latest   GPA   was 3.3.Student   #:  i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Average daily study-hour:  xi 11 7 10 6 12 9 6 8 9 11 GPA:  yi 3.2 2.6 3. 1 2.6 3.3 3.0 2.4 2.9 2.8 3.4 
Five sample sums have been calculated from this   sample   data   set   as   follows:

Part A. Basic concepts (15 marks) 
Q01 (2 marks): What is the appropriate population for the survey   (or the random   sample)?
Q02 (3 marks): How many different samples of 10   students   could be   drawn   from the population   indicated   in   Q01?
Q03   (10   marks): For and just for this question (Q03) only,   suppose   that   Mr. Simon also   randomly   surveyed   10   students yesterday from the same population indicated in Q01.
Q03a (2 marks): Are Ariel’s and   Simon’s samples the same   (i.e.,   do   they have   the   same   10   students?)
Q03b (2 marks): Will the two samples   have the same   average   GPA?
Q03c (2 marks): Which of   the two samples will have an   average   GPA   closer to the population   average?
Q03d (2   marks):   Will   the   two samples   produce   the same sample   regression   model   to explain GPA (y)   using average   daily study-hour   (x)?
Q03e   (2   marks):   Which   of the   two   samples   will   produce   a   sample   regression   model   closer   to   the   population   regression   model?

How about μx = 11?
